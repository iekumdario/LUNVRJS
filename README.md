# LUNVRJS

[This app solves the book it to the moon challenge from the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2016](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/solar-system/book-it-to-the-moon/projects/lunvr)

Web and Android VR App. Find the current position of the moon and unlock stories and content!

Search for the moon in virtual reality from space! Find out the position relative from whenever you are on earth. Watch the current moon phase and learn facts about moon.
We've developed an interactive web and android app for children that lets the user look for the moon in space. The position of the moon is relative to the user's position on earth so you can search for the moon in VR (or not, when using the web or when VR glasses are not available) and take off the glasses and see the actual moon in the same place if the sky is clear at night. If you find the moon you'll see it's current phase and will listen a moon related story with interesting facts about the moon along with pictures.

Our app works on the web and on any smartphone VR viewer.
